This file offer a clear developpement environnement for THREE.js on a node.js server with Class implementation.

It was designed to make it easier to implement the different objects in a THREE.js scene with a RAPIER world.
And so:
- Implementing custom and pre-compiled shaders.
- Integration of uploaded FBX custom objects.
- 
This is a node app, so install first node.js app.

To work properly upload the file and create an npm environnement with the dependencies in it (look at the package.json) if you don't have:
  npm init -y
  npm install body-parser
  npm install ejs
  npm install express
  npm install gsap
  npm install three

  Animate your world.scene on your mainIndex.js file.
